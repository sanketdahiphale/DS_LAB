        "The developed expert system uses 'if-then' rules to recommend activities based on weather conditions. Its decision-making capabilities are based on a direct matching of input facts against predefined conditions in the rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system's rules are structured as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a rule and contains two keys:\n",
        "1.  `\"conditions\"`: A dictionary specifying the 'if' part of the rule (e.g., `{'weather': 'sunny', 'temperature': 'warm'}`).\n",
        "2.  `\"recommendation\"`: A string describing the 'then' part (e.g., `'Go for a walk or a picnic in the park.'`).\n",
        "\n",
        "The inference engine, implemented as the `recommend_activity` function, takes a dictionary of `facts` as input. It iterates through the defined rules, checking if all conditions within a rule match the provided facts. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding recommendation. If no rule's conditions are fully met by the given facts, it returns a default message: \"No specific recommendation based on current facts.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A set of four 'if-then' rules was defined, covering various weather scenarios and their corresponding activity recommendations:\n",
        "    *   **Sunny and warm:** \"Go for a walk or a picnic in the park.\"\n",
        "    *   **Rainy:** \"Read a book, watch a movie, or play board games indoors.\"\n",
        "    *   **Cold and freezing:** \"Stay indoors, have hot chocolate, or go ice skating if possible.\"\n",
        "    *   **Cloudy and mild:** \"Visit a museum or art gallery.\"\n",
        "*   The inference engine successfully matched given facts to the predefined rules, providing accurate recommendations for `{'weather': 'sunny', 'temperature': 'warm'}`, `{'weather': 'rainy'}`, `{'weather': 'cold', 'temperature': 'freezing'}`, and `{'weather': 'cloudy', 'temperature': 'mild'}`.\n",
        "*   The system correctly identified when no specific rule applied, returning the message \"No specific recommendation based on current facts.\" for facts such as `{'weather': 'snowy', 'temperature': 'cold'}` or `{'temperature': 'warm'}` (where a required `weather` condition was missing).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current system provides a basic, rule-based decision-making capability. To enhance its utility, consider implementing a mechanism for handling partial matches or assigning a confidence score to recommendations when multiple rules might partially apply.\n",
        "*   The system could be extended to allow for more complex conditions (e.g., using ranges for temperature or combining multiple conditions with logical operators) or to integrate user input for dynamically adding or modifying rules.\n"
